# Pi Bot
This project is a robot for the Raspberry pi platform. This robot that uses the rasberry pi as the brains of the device.

## Features
- **Camera:** 5MP, 1080p
- **Microphone:** I2S MEMS microphone with a range of about 50Hz - 15KHz, good for just about all general audio recording/detection.
- **Speaker:** This small mono class D amplifier able to deliver 1.6 Watts of power into a 8 ohm impedance speaker
- **Servos:** Output for 9 separate servos. These include a 180 degree servo for the camera and 2 360 servos for the wheels.
- **Accelerometer:** 3-axis accelerometer
- **Gyroscope:** 3-axis gyroscope
- **Magnetometer:** 3-axis magnetometer
- **Barometer:** Environmental sensor with temperature, barometric pressure with Â±1 meter accuracy.
- **Addressable RGB LEDs:** Three primary color can achieve 256 brightness with a refresh rate is 30fps,
- **OLED Display:** Display made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels. Display used for notifications and AI status
- **Menu Buttons:** 4 tactile buttons. Three are used for menu navigation and the third is used for waking up from power off mode. 
- **PWM Fan:** 40mm fan with dynamic speed control
- **Modular Port:** Used to connect to 2 other devices through SPI.

## Initial setup
